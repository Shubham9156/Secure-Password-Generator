# Secure-Password-Generator

Certainly! Below is a Python code example for a simple secure password generator. This generator creates strong, random passwords with a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. It uses the secrets library, which is suitable for generating secure random numbers and strings.

We use the secrets library to generate secure random characters.
The generate_password function allows you to specify the desired length of the password. By default, it generates a 12-character password.
To create a strong password, it ensures that at least one character is chosen from each of the following character sets: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
The rest of the password is filled with random characters from all character sets, and the final password is shuffled for randomness.
You can adjust the length variable to generate passwords of different lengths. This is a basic example, and you can further customize it to include specific character sets or meet particular password requirements if needed.
